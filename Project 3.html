								<h2>FORECASTING SOLAR IRRADIANCE FOR SOLAR FARMS IN RAJASTHAN
								</h2>
							</header>
								<p>Renewable energy is gaining prominence worldwide due to the depletion of natural reserves and their harmful effects, which are triggering global climate change. </p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/solar.jpg" alt=""/></div>
							<p>Solar energy is the fastest-growing sector, contributing to more than two-thirds of the <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/renewable-power-on-course-to-shatter-more-records-as-countries-around-the-world-speed-up-deployment" style="color:blue;">growth</a>. However, solar energy output is often affected by unfavorable weather conditions. Scheduling, generation, and the efficiency of photovoltaic farms can benefit from advance knowledge of estimated solar irradiance.</p>
							<p>To provide a short-term estimate, deep learning techniques like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) were employed, using various weather and solar parameters in a time series. The system's efficiency was enhanced through hyperparameter optimization using various 'bio-inspired' techniques."</p>
							<p> The code can be accessed in detail <a href="https://github.com/Manav-Gupta/Solar-Irradiance-Bio-Inspired" style="color:blue;">here</a>.</p>

								<h2>Predicting stock market indices based on public sentiment on Twitter during a pandemic
								</h2>
							</header>	
							<p>During the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, massive high and lowers were observed in the stock markets <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612320306668" style="color:blue;">worldwide</a> as the distribution of essential supplies was disrupted. Since, there was a complete lockdown employed, people took to social media to express their opinions. </p>
							<div class="image main 1"><img src="images/social media.png" alt=""/></div>
							<p>There have been many efforts to predict market movement using social media sentiment, but this time was particularly interesting due to the increased traffic on the platforms along with people tuning in to get frequent updates and statistics related to Covid-19 in their area. Below are wordmaps created to display the positive(left) and the negative(right) sentiments of users. </p>
