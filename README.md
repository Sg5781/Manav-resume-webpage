# Manav-resume-webpage
This GitHub repository contains a portfolio website created by me for the client, Manav. The portfolio showcases a variety of projects including urban mapping, crop classification, and astronomy-related works. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website highlights Manav's projects in a visually appealing and interactive manner.
