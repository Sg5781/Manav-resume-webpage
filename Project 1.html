								<h2>Enhanced Land use mapping for flood risk analysis using super-resolution and image segmentation techniques in China
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Rapidly increasing global population has resulted in a massive migration of people to urban areas, contributing to unsustainable landscape growth. This has made mapping these areas increasingly challenging, rendering them more vulnerable to disasters such as floods</p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/gif1.gif" alt=""/></div>
							<p>A solution for mapping and classifying such dynamic areas is using satellite imagery and computer vision techniques like <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/10/1667" style="color:blue;">semantic segmentation</a>
								. A segmentation model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was applied in this analysis</p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/gif2.gif" alt=""/></div>
							<p>For the analysis, the <a href="https://x-ytong.github.io/project/GID.html" style="color:blue;">GID dataset</a>  from the Gaofen-2 satellite was used as it has multiple high resolution RGB images from across China with multiple categories to classify the landscape.</p>
							<div class="image main 1"><img src="images/p1image1.png" alt=""/></div>
							<p>However, high resolution satellite data is not easily available. It is cost and time intensive to acquire such data which makes it harder to scale and replicate. To counter this issue, a technique called super-resolution was applied to a degraded version of high-resolution image. Following this, image segmentation was applied again to observe the loss in performance.</p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/p1image2.png" alt=""/>
								<img src="images/p1image3.png" alt=""/></div>
							<p>A marginal drop was observed in the results when a low-resolution image was used compared to a high-resolution image. This proves that with such a model can be used to get a scalable and cost-efficient model for urban mapping around coastal areas. </p>
